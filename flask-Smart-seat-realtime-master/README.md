This file is not yet finished. It could be more robust and logistic. 

This is a simple website of library seats system. It fullfilled two main functions:
1. Login, or if you don't have the account, you could click signup to create an account. Login would take you to the seat reservation
page. You could select available seat in the database.
2. View. Simply view another section of the library, the seats there could not be used but you may be able to see whether you 
should go to the library if the seats for reservation are all reserved by others.

In the login and signup pages, the link "Back to Home" would lead to no where but error.
